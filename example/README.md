# flutter_fusioncharts_example

Demonstrates how to use the flutter_fusioncharts plugin.

## Getting Started

Follow the detailed instructions provided as part of the plugin setup (WIP).
Once you have completed those instructions, verify:
1. You have Flutter V3.0 or above installed locally
2. In the project root, you should have a .env file which contains License Key in format: LICENSE_KEY="<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY>" (this is just a recommended way, you can manage the key as feel fit for your project)
3. Ensure you have fusioncharts folder in the project root (download from CDN url)
4. Run `flutter pub get` and `flutter run` to run the app in debug mode

The example app provides comprehensive list of charts that you can pick and plugin within your project codebase. 

For any support please view the open issues at git hub repo of the [ plugin](https://github.com/fusioncharts/flutter-fusioncharts/issues)
